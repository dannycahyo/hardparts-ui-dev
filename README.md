## The Hard Parts of UI Development - Lesson Learned
This repository contains the code examples and exercises from the Frontend Masters course ["The Hard Parts of UI Development"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hard-parts-ui-dev/) by Will Sentance.

### Course Description
In this course, you'll learn the hard parts of UI development that most tutorials and courses don't cover. You'll learn how to build complex UI components from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on frameworks or libraries. You'll also learn how to use the virtual DOM to optimize performance and reduce the number of DOM manipulations.

### Getting Started
To get started with the code examples and exercises, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannycahyo/hardparts-ui-dev.git
cd hardparts-ui-dev
```

Then, open the index.html file in your web browser to see the examples in action.

### Course Outline
The course is divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction
2. Building a Virtual DOM
3. Building a Component
4. Optimizing Performance with Diffing Algorithms

Each section contains code examples and exercises that build on the concepts covered in the previous sections.

### Prerequisites
To get the most out of this course, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You should also be familiar with the DOM and how to manipulate it using JavaScript.
